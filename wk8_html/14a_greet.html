        <!-- We don't want this form to be submitted to the server via get or post.
             Just like our previous example of submitting a form, it goes to google.com/search.
             We actually want our JavaScript code to take control over the entire user experience of this form
             so that I'm just using the form as a user input mechanism.
             If you hard-code "return false", which tells the browser not to submit the form, then just calls the greet function.-->
