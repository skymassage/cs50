             viewport: control the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page),
                       a <meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
             content: describe metadata within an HTML document
             initial-scale=1.0: set the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
                                The initial scale should be 1. That is no matter who visits your site,
                                it shouldn't start zoomed in or zoomed out, it should start at just the default sizing.
                                (Minimum: 0.1. Maximum: 10. Default: 1)
             width=device-width: set the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device
                                 (which will vary depending on the device). -->

        <!-- If you've ever shared a URL on Facebook or Twitter or Discord or any number of websites nowadays
             that automatically show a preview where you suddenly see the default image of the page,
             maybe a few sentences or words of text or something like that. Sometimes those applications,
             those websites, will just choose the first image it finds on the website or the first sentence it sees and show that.
             But that might not be very user friendly or search engine friendly.
             And so a developer might want to control what it is that Discord, Facebook, Twitter, and other such sites show by default.
             For that you can use nowadays what are called "open graph" (OG) tags, which is to say there's other uses of the meta tag.
             And you just look these things up.-->
        <!-- The meta tag can also have a "property" attribute that can be these very specific strings.
             OG title, OG description, OG image, which denotes Open Graph, which again,
             is this standard that's evolved in recent years.
             And what you can do here is to tell browsers and in turn servers what you want them to show as the default title of the page,
             the description of the page, and even the default image just so you can exercise more control when sharing things socially nowadays as well.
             It just boils down to these key value pairs.  -->
        <!-- Note that these key value pairs relate to the title and description of the web page. -->
