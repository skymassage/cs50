            Here is a form:
            <!-- An HTML "form" is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.
                 The thing with text boxes and buttons that you and I use every day on any number of websites. -->
            <form>
                <p>
                    <!-- <input ...>: define a field within an HTML form. -->
                    <!-- name & value: is used to reference form data after a form is submitted, or to reference elements in a JavaScript.
                                       so that the back-end server can retrieve the corresponding field value through the specified name.
                                       Thus, there are two attributes "name" and "value" which are a key-value pair, "name" is a key and "value" is a value. -->
                    <!-- type: is what type of data it accepts. -->
                    Text: <input name="text0" type="text" >
                    <!-- The type "text" create basic single-line text fields. -->
                    <!-- Here we don't set the attribute "value", so the value of the key "text0" is what you type in this textbox. -->

                    Password: <input name="password0" type="password" >
                    <!-- The type "password" provide a way for the user to securely enter a password. -->

                    <div>
                        Radio 1: <input name="radio0" type="radio" >
                        <!-- Radio buttons are normally presented in radio groups
                             (a collection of radio buttons describing a set of related options).
                             Only one radio button in a group can be selected at the same time.
                             As long as each radio button has the same name, that's why they are mutually exclusive.
                             Therefore, selecting one radio button turns off the other radio buttons because they have the same name.
                             Radio buttons are typically rendered as small circles,
                             which are filled or highlighted when selected. -->
