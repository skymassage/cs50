        <!-- Responsive design is about making sure that the web pages look good, no matter how you're looking at the web page,
             such as viewing websites on computers, smartphones and tablets. -->
        <!-- We can achieve this through knowledge of the viewport.
             The viewport is the part of the screen that is actually visible to the user at any given time.
             By default, many webpages assume that the viewport is the same on any device, which is what leads to many sites
             (especially older ones) being difficult to interact with on mobile devices.
             One simple way to improve the appearance of a site on a mobile device is to add the following line in the head of our HTML files.
             This line tells the mobile device to use a viewport that is the same width as that of the device youâ€™re using rather than a much larger one. -->
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

            /* Another way we can deal with different devices is through media queries.
               Media queries are ways of changing the style of a page based on how the page is being viewed. */
            /* Use the '@' symbol and say "media" and then specify for what type of media I would like to apply this query.
               We can use these media queries to fine tune control how our page is going to look on various different types of devices. */
            @media (min-width: 600px) {
                /* If the width of the page is 600 pixels or larger, the background color is red. */
                body {
                    background-color: red;
