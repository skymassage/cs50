flask run: Flask is a third-party library that allows you to host web applications using the Flask framework within Python.
           You can run flask by executing flask run. To do so, you will need a file called app.py
           and a folder called templates containing the html files.
           You must get into the folder storing your web code and materials, and run this command to execute Flask.
