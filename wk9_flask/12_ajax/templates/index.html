        {#<!-- Here is no form and button for submitting because it all happens automatically.
               But there is by default the empty <ul> that has nothing by default until we start using that API (Application Programming Interface ). -->#}

        {#<!-- We are going to make a user interface that uses a technique called AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML),
               which uses various web technologies together, including JavaScript,
               to send and receive data from a server asynchronously,
               without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page and having to submit a form.
               You can secretly in JavaScript code send a request to the server to get back more data,
               and then plug it into the DOM. This makes for more seamless experiences like autocomplete on any website.
               What Ajax allows us to do is basically refresh certain parts of the page, rather than the entire page.
               For example, you might see this if you're on a sports website where scores of games that are going on currently are being updated, but the whole page doesn't refresh.  -->#}

            /* "async" is used to declare an asynchronous function which is a function that returns a object called "promise".

               In JavaScript, a promise is a constructor (also an object) that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.
               It's a way to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the rest of your code. A promise is in one of three states:
               1. Pending: The promise's outcome hasn't yet been determined, because the asynchronous operation that will produce its result hasn't completed yet.
               2. Fulfilled: The asynchronous operation has completed, and the promise has a resulting value.
               3. Rejected: The asynchronous operation failed, and the promise will never be fulfilled. In the rejected state, a promise has a reason that indicates why the operation failed.
               Besides, there is another term  called "resolved" which is a bit more general. A promise is considered resolved if it is either fulfilled or rejected.
               However, there's a slight nuance: a promise can also be resolved to another promise.
               This means that the resolution of the first promise is actually dependent on the resolution of the second promise.
               So, all fulfilled and rejected promises are resolved, but a resolved promise is not necessarily fulfilled or rejected - it could be waiting on another promise.

               "async" also allows you to use "await" within the asynchronous function.
               "await" can be used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or rejected,
               making it easier to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous style. */

            input.addEventListener('input', async function() {
                /* Here, "async" is used to declare an asynchronous event handler function.
                   This allows the use of "await" to pause the functions while waiting for the server's response,
                   without blocking the rest of the code from running. */

                let response = await fetch('/search?q=' + input.value);
                /* It sends an asynchronous GET request to the server at the path '/search' with a query parameter 'q' set to the value of the input field.
                   "await" is used to wait for the promise returned by "fetch()" to resolve with the server's response. */
                /* "fetch()" is a built-in JavaScript function used to make HTTP requests.
                   By default, "fetch()" makes a GET request. If you wanted to make a POST request,
                   you would need to specify it in the options like so: fetch(url, {method: 'POST'}).*/

                let shows = await response.text();
                /* "fetch()" does indeed return a promise.
                   However, when this promise resolves, it gives us a response object which contains
                   the status of the request, the headers, and the body of the response.
                   The promise resolves with a response object once the server responds to the request.
                   The response object represents the response to the request and provides methods to access
                   the body of the response in various formats, such as ".text()" for text format or ".json()" for JSON format.
                   So, in short, "fetch()" returns a promise that resolves to a response object.

                   Here, "response" is the response object that the promise from "fetch()" resolved to.
                   We then call the ".text()" method on this response object to read the response body as text, which also returns a promise.
                   This promise will resolve to the actual data you're interested in.
                   And "await" is used to wait for this operation to complete.
                   The resulting text ("response.text()") is the HTML string generated by the search.html template. */

                document.querySelector('ul').innerHTML = shows;
                /* "shows" in the app.py and search.html is a list of dictionaries, and looks like this: [{'title': 'title_1', ...other columns...}, {'title': 'title_2', ...other columns...}, ...].
                   "document.querySelector('ul').innerHTML=shows" here is a string that contains the HTML inside the <ul> element, and looks like this: <li>title_1</li><li>title_2</li>...
                   When making the AJAX call in the JavaScript code, it sends a request to the "/search" route in the Flask application app.py.
                   app.py then queries shows.db and sends the results (the "shows" list of dictionaries) to the search.html template.
                   The template renders this data (looks like "<li>title_1</li><li>title_2</li>...") into HTML.
                   This rendered HTML is what your AJAX call receives as a response, whose .text() is "<li>title_1</li><li>title_2</li>...". */
